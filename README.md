Dungeonite is a 2D maze-solver where the player navigates three rooms, two of them being composed of large mazes, which they must traverse, collecting a key from each room before being capable of entering the end room. Each maze is randomly generated each time the player enters the room. After finishing the game you have the option of playing again at an increased difficulty. Whenever you lose, your fastest completion time is displayed. 

The user should run the main.py file. No special files are used that must be set up, nor are any libraries utilized, either.
